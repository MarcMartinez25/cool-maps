This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) mapping project built with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm devs
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Goal

The goal here is to get familiar with the OpenLayers API and create an app where runners can create routes and download the data to their watch of choice.
